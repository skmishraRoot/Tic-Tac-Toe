Programming language is an essential skill to learn in today's world. So why not Learn one of them?
In this Documentation, we will learn about how to make a tic-tac-toe game using the python language.




We will complete this project in various steps so let's dive into the process of developing our game.

Step-1:-Setting up the environment.

Downloading and setting up python.

Link to download python>>

We need a text editor to make our programming easy so we will install Visual studio code as our Text editor software.

Link to download vscode-

Create a file called tictactoe.py in the text editor
    * Open a folder in your text editor.
    * Click on create a new file.
    * Name that file tictactoe.py

Step-2:-Importing the important module and libraries.

We need the Tkinter module to develop the Gui of our application. 
Tkinter is the de facto way in Python to create Graphical User interfaces (GUIs) and is included in all standard Python Distributions. 
It's the only framework built into the Python standard library.
For importing the Tkinter module we don't need to make any downloads. 
We simply say import tkinter at the start of our code.
